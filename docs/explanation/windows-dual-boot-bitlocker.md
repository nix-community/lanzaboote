# Windows Dual-Boot and BitLocker

For Windows dual-booters and BitLocker users, it is highly recommended
that you export your BitLocker recovery keys and confirm that they are
correct. Please refer to this [Microsoft support article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/finding-your-bitlocker-recovery-key-in-windows-6b71ad27-0b89-ea08-f143-056f5ab347d6)
for help. This will be required once you finish this guide to confirm
with BitLocker that the PCRs changed during the next measurement are
intended and allows the TPM unlocking of Windows to work as normal.
